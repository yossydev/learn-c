## Summary

I started AtCoder because I want to study algorithms.
Since I am going to use C++ as the language, this is the repository for the study.

I am studying by looking at what AtCoder officially provides for learning (https://atcoder.jp/contests/apg4b).

## Test

If you want to check if your program works properly, type the following command

```bash
// Compile.
$ . /scrips/compile.sh

// Run the program.
$ . /bin/files to check
```
